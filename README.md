##AnyWheel

# System Requirements
To run AnyWheel you'll need a couple of things.
-A computer.  Tested on Windows.
-Working installations of Python, Pygame and PyUserInput.  Tested with Python 3.4.
-An XBox gamepad or similar controller.  Tested with a Logitech Dual Action.

# Using AnyWheel
Run AnyWheel.py.  If you have two monitors, I recommend putting AnyWheel in the smaller one and whatever you're typing in in the bigger one.

From there, select the window you want to type in.  AnyWheel will run in the background.  Move the left stick to select a group of letters then press the corresponding button.  The left and right bumpers will switch sets.  Basically, if you've used the daisy-wheel keyboard in Steam, this should be similar.

This is just a quick thing I whipped up because I wanted to make my gamepad more useful.  I don't guarantee it's going to work on your system.  However you're free to edit, tinker with, and reuse this code for anything you want.  Credit would be nice but it's not necessary.
